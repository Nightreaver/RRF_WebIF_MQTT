#      mqtt-smarthome - Publish to an MQTT broker following the mqtt-smarthome proposal
#                       (https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome)
#  homeassistant-mqtt - Publish to an MQTT broker following the HomeAssistant discovery format
#                       (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/)
#    thingsboard-json - Publish to the ThingsBoard MQTT broker
#                       (https://thingsboard.io)
#    wirenboard-mqtt -  Publish to the Wiren Board MQTT broker
#                       (https://wirenboard.com)
#                json - Print to stdout as json encoded strings

# Enable TLS/SSL on the connection
#tls = false

# Path to CA Certificate file to verify host

[Printers]

# Add your Mi Flora sensors here. Each sensor consists of a name and a Ethernet MAC address.
# Additional location information can be added to the name, delimited by an '@'.
# Scan for sensors from the command line with:
#    $ sudo hcitool lescan
#
# Examples:
#
# MyPrinter = 192.168.0.251
